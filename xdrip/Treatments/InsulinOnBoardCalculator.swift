/// InsulinYetToBeConsumed is - and should be - a PURE FUNCTION.

///
/// Why is this calculation implemented as a PURE FUNCTION?
/// This function is called numerous time, and being a pure function allows for, IF NEEDED, safely cache the results of it.
///
/// This function is heavly based on the following sources and matches the same formula:
